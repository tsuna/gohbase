      "message": "Instead of having to pass c.reestablishRegion here, maybe clientDown could return a boolean to indicate whether or not you\u0027re the first one to find out that this region is unavailable?\n\nAlso clientDown() will mark all the regions that are using the same region.Client as unavailable.  But we don\u0027t do this when dealing with the meta region, which seems wrong to me.  If the meta region is unavailable because of an unrecoverable error, we should probably apply the same logic as clientDown.  The problem might be that we can\u0027t because at line 77 won\u0027t find the client connected to the RS housing the meta region, so we won\u0027t be able to invalidate other regions..?  If yes, then that\u0027s probably an indication that we need to revisit some things, as this is definitely a latent bug / code smell.",

      "message": "The reason I chose to not apply the same or similar logic to the meta region is because the meta region is never in our caches, we maintain direct pointers to both the regioninfo and the region client, and even with these proposed changes the meta region client will never be used by any regioninfo except the metaRegionInfo. Either we could move the meta region info and client into the cache, and stop treating them as special, or we\u0027ll not be able to apply cache specific logic like clientDown to them.\n\nAlso a boolean return value isn\u0027t sufficient, since a separate goroutine is started for each region that has not yet been marked as unavailable, so how about if clientDown returned a list of all regions that must be reestablished?",
